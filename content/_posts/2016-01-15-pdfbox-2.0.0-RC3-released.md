The Apache PDFBox community is pleased to announce the release of
Apache PDFBox version 2.0.0 RC3. The release is available for download at:

[https://pdfbox.apache.org/download.cgi](https://pdfbox.apache.org/download.cgi)

The numerous feedback on our second release candidate helps us to make
this release candidate better again, e. g. optimized font cache, improved text
extraction. A lot of bug fixes are included as well.
We'd like to thank everybody who helps us to get a step foward.
Please have a look at the new release candidate as well, so that the next
release hopefully could be the final one.

See the [full release notes](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310760&version=12319281) for details about this release.
