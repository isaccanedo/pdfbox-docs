With the initial discussions starting 3 years ago PDFBox 2.0.0 is in the works for
quite some time now - **and we are in the final stages!** To give you the opportunity
to provide feedback a [PDFBox 2.0.0-RC1 Release Candidate](https://pdfbox.apache.org/download.cgi)
is now available.

The [Migration Guide](https://pdfbox.apache.org/2.0/migration.html) shall give users coming from
PDFBox 1.8 or earlier an overview about things to look at when switching over. More details to come.
